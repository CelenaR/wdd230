                from the hustle and bustle of London city life. The home page is a white, clean minimal design. 
                The logo and navigation is easy to find. Only a few simple  pictures are on the main page.

            <p class="description"> This website has unique one of a kind art pieces to admire and purchase.
                It also shows films from up and coming artists. The home screen is all
                laid out in box format. Everything is lined up from the left to the right 
                hand side. Even the images in the center of the screen line up with each other.
                There is a mix of centered, vertical, and horizontal alignment.

            <p class="description">This website shows exactly where it wants its viewers to
                look at first. The one main image for the whole background shows a bunch of
                books. Right in the middle of the page it wants you to use its search menu to 
                look up a quote. There are only a few things on the main page to look at.
                It doesn't want its reader to get confused on  what to search for on this site.
